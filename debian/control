Description: The Java ZeroMQ bindings
 The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the standard
 socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by specialised
 messaging middleware products. 0MQ sockets provide an abstraction
 of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns, message
 filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
 protocols and more.
 This package contains the Java Bindings for ZeroMQ.
